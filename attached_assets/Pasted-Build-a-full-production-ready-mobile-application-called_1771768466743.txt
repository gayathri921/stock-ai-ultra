Build a full production-ready mobile application called StockAI Ultra, a secure AI-powered real-time stock intelligence platform using React Native with Expo and TypeScript for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js and MongoDB Atlas (Mongoose) for the backend. Implement complete authentication including email signup, login, logout, JWT access and refresh tokens, bcrypt password hashing, protected routes, secure token storage, and session timeout handling. Add a Settings screen with biometric authentication using Expo Local Authentication (fingerprint for Android and Face ID for iOS) with enable/disable toggle and implement a secure 4-digit PIN-based app lock system with setup, change PIN option, auto-lock timer, and secure storage using SecureStore, ensuring no sensitive data is stored in plain text. Integrate real-time stock updates using WebSocket (Socket.io) and live stock APIs such as Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance, displaying live price, daily change, volume, market cap, and basic charts. Add portfolio management with stock tracking, quantity, buy price, profit/loss calculation, performance summary, and smart alerts for target price and stop-loss. Include an AI Chat Assistant powered by OpenAI API that answers stock-related questions using live market data and returns structured responses including summary, buy/hold/sell recommendation, confidence percentage, risk level, explanation in simple language, and disclaimer, storing chat history securely per user in MongoDB. Add an AI Voice Assistant with microphone input that converts speech to text, sends it to backend AI service, and converts AI responses back to speech using Expo Speech with visible transcript and loading animation. Implement multi-language support using i18n with dynamic language switching inside Settings supporting at least English and one additional language with instant UI updates and secure preference storage. Design a professional fintech UI with dark mode default, light mode toggle, smooth animations, splash screen, and properly configured high-resolution app icon. Ensure secure architecture, proper error handling, scalable folder structure separating frontend and backend, environment variable protection for all API keys (OpenAI and stock API), MongoDB Atlas connection via secure connection string, and clear backend configuration setup. The application must be structured so that after manual configuration of API keys, MongoDB Atlas connection, and backend deployment, it can generate a real downloadable Android APK through Expo build process and function as a fully real-time standalone mobile application once deployed.
